Use After Free Challenge
========================

This is a use after free challenge that is intended to be a high-level 
bin challenge. It is to be run as a service on a computer that has 64 
bit ASLR and NX on. It also uses stack cookies, although there shouldn't 
be any stack buffer overflows, this is mostly to signal that stack 
overflows shouldn't be tried.

The exploit is that a reference to your "favorite item" is maintained 
after freeing.

An example of the correct exploitation strategy can be seen in do.py.

A method for allowing them to learn the address of a function in the 
binary is mandatory because of ASLR. It is achieved through letting the 
user set what type of item their favorite item is.

This challenge is ready to be released.

Release Notes
=============

This should be run in a locked down environment on a virtual machine. It 
is possible to get a shell with this binary!!!!!! Furthermore, it is 
important that the competitors know that the file is located in key.txt
